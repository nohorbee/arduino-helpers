So, for example, instead of being thinking of \"sending a HIGH to a digital output\",\r\na developer should think of:\r\n\r\n1. Create an instance of a particular component `LED led = LED(ledPin);`\r\n2. Lights on: `led.on();`\r\n\r\nBy thinking the components helpers as *instanceable* classes, then the components are variables that can be passed as parameters in methods, allowing the developers to write smart code for building their projects.\r\n\r\nTake a look at each submodule documentation for a quick start.\r\n\r\n## Spirit\r\n\r\nBy creating an Open Source project, and putting some basic examples, I'm intending to get other helpers by contributors and put these all together within this project.",
